# Huffman Text Compression üöÄ

A powerful text compression tool implementing Huffman Coding, an optimal lossless compression algorithm. This project allows users to input text and receive a compressed binary representation along with compression statistics, execution time, and Huffman character mappings.
## Live Demo
[Live Demo](https://thegravityfalls-11.github.io/HuffMan-Coding/)

## What Problem Does It Solve? ü§î

### 1. Reduces Text Size Efficiently üìâ

- Compresses input text into a smaller binary format, saving storage space.
- Displays original vs. compressed size and compression ratio.

### 2. Provides Compression Insights üìä

- Shows execution time for compression.
- Displays Huffman character mappings.
- Visualizes compression ratio with a circular progress bar.

### 3. Improves Data Transmission & Storage üìÇ

- Useful for sending large text data over networks with reduced bandwidth.
- Helps in storing large documents efficiently.

## Technology Stack üõ†Ô∏è

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (UI & Animations)
- **Backend Logic (Client-Side)**: JavaScript (for Huffman Encoding Algorithm)
- **Data Visualization**: SVG for progress circles, dynamic DOM manipulation for stats display

## Features ‚ú®

### 1. Intuitive User Interface

- Simple text input field with a clean design.
- "Compress" button to initiate Huffman encoding.
- Animated loading indicator during compression.

### 2. Real-Time Compression Statistics

- Original & Compressed Size: Displays text size before and after compression.
- Compression Ratio: Visualized with a dynamic circular progress bar.
- Execution Time: Measures the time taken for compression.

### 3. Huffman Encoding Details

- Compressed Binary Output: Displays the compressed binary representation of the input text.
- Character Mappings: Shows the Huffman code assigned to each character.

### 4. Algorithm Complexity Analysis ‚ö°

- Displays Time Complexity (O(n log n)) and Space Complexity (O(n)) of Huffman coding.
- Explains why Huffman Compression is efficient with a tooltip feature.

## Setup & Installation üöÄ

Follow the steps below to set up and run Huffman Text Compression on your local system.

### Prerequisites

- A web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.).
- A local or online server for execution (optional, but improves performance).

### Running the Project

#### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/TheGravityFalls-11/HuffMan-Coding.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

```sh
cd HuffMan-Coding
```

#### 3. Open `index.html` in a browser

- Simply double-click `index.html` or open it via VS Code Live Server.

#### 4. (Optional) Run on a Local Server

```sh
python -m http.server 8000  # Runs a simple Python HTTP server
```

Then, open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
